define Package/safe-reboot/description
  When you run $PKG_NAME specifying a grace time, it makes a backup of /etc at that point,
  and after the grace time reboots the system. At the next boot, it waits again for a timeout;
  if you can't login and delete the backup, it will restore it and reboot.
  This mechanism makes it possible to run $PKG_NAME, try risky operations (like restarting
  the network), and if something goes wrong, just wait for the fallback timeout.
  Even more, you can make actual changes to /etc config and reboot. If it comes back up right,
  you can login and delete the backup. If something went wrong with the new /etc, just wait
  for the revert timeout.
